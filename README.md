# Hypernode test environment for MacOSX and Linux

You can start developing on your own local Hypernode within 15 minutes.

## Starting the test environment

1. Install [Virtualbox 4.3.18 or
later](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), or [LXC](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html) (experimental).
2. Install [Vagrant 1.6.4 or later](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant.git) using Git or download the [zip file](https://github.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant/archive/master.zip) from Github.


```
# check if version > 1.6.4 ?
vagrant --version 
cd hypernode-vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
```

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

Virtualbox can be rather slow. In case you are on Linux you can also use LXC instead.

Change the synced folder type in local.yml to something other than virtualbox like rsync or nfs:
```
fs:
  type: rsync
```

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc
vagrant up --provider lxc
```

Voila! Access your local Hypernode through [http://hypernode.local/](http://hypernode.local/) or [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Using the test environment

### Uploading files

The local directories `data/web/public/` and `data/web/nginx/` are bound to the Vagrant image. You can use this local dir to edit all your files.

So fire up PHPStorm and edit away locally. Then check out the Hypernode box to see results.

### SSH

SSH is available at port 22 on hostname hypernode.local, or at port 2222 localhost.

```bash
ssh app@hypernode.local
```

You can use this config snippet for SSH to ease logging in and then just `ssh hypernode.local`:

```
Host hypernode.local
    Hostname hypernode.local
    User app
    StrictHostKeyChecking no  
    # because the host key will change over time
```

### PHP version

The default php version is 5.5. To boot a hypernode-vagrant box with php 7.0 edit the local.yml file.

Change local.yml to:
```bash
php:
  version: 7.0
```

Destroy and re-create the box
```bash
vagrant destroy -f
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

### MySQL

MySQL is available at hostname hypernode.local, port 3306 or at localhost, port 3307.

```bash
# find you MySQL password in /data/web/.my.cnf by loging in to SSH
# ssh app@hypernode.local cat /data/web/.my.cnf

mysql -u app --host=hypernode.local -p
```

To connect directly from the vagrant directory you can use `vagrant ssh`. This will log you in as the `vagrant` user.
This will allow you to use `sudo` and manage the server. Do not use this for normal operation, however, the app user should be used for normal usage and as the website user.

### Mail

All mail is redirected to a local [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) instance. Access MailHog at http://b033d.hypernode.local:8025 \(replace name with your instance's hostname\).

![Mail is routed to MailHog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant/12f11242e4ed66631ee2dc4e44390b3f62c27932/Documentation/mailhog.png "MailHog impression")


## Keeping up to date with Hypernode versions

With every Hypernode release, we'll update the Hypernode vagrant image as well. Use the following to update your box (you'll lose your MySQL data unless you make a mysqldump first!):

```bash
vagrant box update
# optionally backup MySQL, whose data is not currently in a shared directory
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
```

## Customizing the setup

You might have some ports already in use. Hypernode by default forwards ports 2222 to 22, 3307 to 3306 and 8080 to 80.

Collisions will be automatically resolved, Vagrant will print the newly assigned ports if that happens.

If you want to change these ports, just have a look at the Vagrant file. It is pretty self-explanatory.

## Running multiple hypernode-vagrant boxes at the same time
If you have two checkouts of this repository or have copied this Vagrantfile to multiple projects, you can run them simultaneously. 
Some things to keep in mind:

1. The static aliases (hypernode.local, hypernode-alias) will point to the
box that was booted last.

2. Aliases are created based on the name of the directory the Vagrantfile
is in. If the dir name is 'hypernode-vagrant' the parent directory name
will be used. You can override this name with an environment variable

3. You can add your own aliases by updating the following section in the local.yml file.
```bash
hostmanager:
  extra-aliases:
    - my-custom-store-url1.local
    - my-custom-store-url2.local
```

```
HYPERNODE_VAGRANT_NAME="mywebshop" vagrant up
```

You can access the node on
```
http://mywebshop.hypernode.local
```

3. If there are two hypernode-vagrants running with the same name, you can still access them both using the alias derived from the path name. The hash based on the Vagrantfile's directory path is always unique because there can only be one Vagrantfile per directory.

```
http://b033d-mywebshop-magweb-vgr.nodes.hypernode.local
http://eb7b8-mywebshop-magweb-vgr.nodes.hypernode.local
```

For the defined aliases check ```/etc/hosts``` on Unix based systems
(Linux, Mac). On Windows see ```C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts```.

## Troubleshooting

### ==> default: stdin: is not a tty

This is Vagrant bug [#1673](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1673) and perfectly harmless.

### The config reloader is not reloading on changes in /data/web/nginx

/data/web/nginx is an NFS mount on your local computer. We use inotify to detect changes in the config files, but NFS is not supporting inotify.
If you want to use automatic config reloads on nginx config changes, change the vagrant file to not use an nfs mount by uncommenting:

    config.vm.synced_folder "data/web/nginx/", "/data/web/nginx/", owner: "app", group: "app", create: true

And then manually sync your nginx config files to the hypernode vagrant box.

### The web pages don't change

Varnish is enabled by default. To check if this is what is causing your pages to remain static try clearing the cache.

```
# this clears the entire varnish cache (warning: makes things slow until cache is filled up again)
varnishadm "ban req.url ~ /"
```

To completely disable Varnish caching
```
# Create a vcl that tells Varnish to cache nothing
echo -e 'vcl 4.0;\nbackend default {\n  .host = "127.0.0.1";\n  .port = "8080";\n}\nsub vcl_recv {\n  return(pass);\n}' > /data/web/disabled_caching.vcl

# Compile the vcl
varnishadm vcl.load nocache /data/web/disabled_caching.vcl

# Load the vcl
varnishadm vcl.use nocache
```

### Transfer closed with x bytes remaining to read

Sometimes there is a connection error while downloading or upgrading the vagrant box. 

```
http://vagrant.hypernode.com/hypernode.vagrant.release-2653.box
An error occurred while downloading the remote file. The error message, if any, is reproduced below. Please fix this error and try again.

transfer closed with 675809792 bytes remaining to read
```

If you get this error you can continue the interrupted download with another ```vagrant up``` (or a ```vagrant box update``` if you have already installed a previous version of the box)
```
