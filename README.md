# Hypernode test environment for MacOSX and Linux

## Starting the test environment

1. Install Virtualbox 4.3.18 or later.
2. Install Vagrant 1.6.4 or later.
3. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant.git) using Git or download the [tarball](https://github.com/ByteInternet/hypernode-vagrant/archive/master.zip) from Github.

```
cd hypernode-vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up
```

## Setting the host
You can use [https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager](vagrant-hostmanager) to automaticly setup and connect your host to your client.

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant up
```

## Using the test environment

### Uploading files

The local directories `data/web/public/` and `data/web/nginx/` are bound to the Vagrant image. You can use this local dir to edit all your files.

So fire up PHPStorm and edit away locally. Then check out the Hypernode box to see results.

### Webserver

Your Magento is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
And when using hostmanager: [http://hypernode.local](http://hypernode.local)

### MySQL

MySQL is available at 127.0.0.1 port 3307.

### SSH

SSH is available on 127.0.0.1 port 2222.

You can use `ssh -p 2222 app@localhost` to connect to SSH. You can also use this config snippet for SSH:

```
Host hn-vagrant
    Hostname 127.0.0.1
    User app
    Port 2222
    StrictHostKeyChecking no  # because the host key will change over time
```

## Customizing the setup

You might have some ports already in use. Hypernode by default forwards ports 2222 to 22, 3307 to 3306 and 8080 to 80.

If you want to change these ports, just have a look at the Vagrant file. It is pretty self-explanatory.

## Troubleshooting

### ==> default: stdin: is not a tty

This is Vagrant bug [#1673](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1673) and perfectly harmless.
